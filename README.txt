Moving Cost Estimator

Problem: Small moving companies manually calculate the cost of a move with pen and paper, wasting time.

Solution: This is an app that solves the problem of estimating the cost of a move by considering user input metrics such as square foot, item amount in pounds, and work crew size.

Minimum Viable Product:
User signs up and can login
User enters:
 -square footage
 -amount of items measured in pounds
 -crew size
App calculates price, displays it to the user
User can save estimates, and retrieve them

DISCLAIMER:
Apps purpose is about learning full stack development and is AI assisted, asking questions
as I go to understand new (to me) technologies used in real world development.
